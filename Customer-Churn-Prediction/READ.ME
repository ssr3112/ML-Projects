Customer churn prediction uses Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) to identify which customers are most likely to stop using a service or product. By analyzing historical customer data and patterns, the model learns to recognize behaviors associated with churn, allowing businesses to proactively intervene and retain valuable customers. This project leverages the robust pattern recognition capabilities of ANNs to provide accurate and actionable predictions
