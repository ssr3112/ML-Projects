# Network Intrusion Detection using Machine Learning

## Project Overview
This project implements a machine learning pipeline to detect network intrusions using a dataset with features extracted from network traffic. Several machine learning models such as Random Forest, XGBoost, and SVM were trained, tuned, and evaluated.

## Dataset
The dataset contains features from normal and anomalous network traffic, used for training and testing. It has around 20k training samples and 5k test samples with 34 features.

## Modeling
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Handling class imbalance with SMOTE
- Model training with Random Forest, XGBoost, and SVM
- Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV
- Evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, f1-score, ROC-AUC, and confusion matrices

## Results
- Random Forest and XGBoost achieved above 99.7% accuracy
- Detailed evaluation metrics and visualizations included in the notebook
